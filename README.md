# 🚀 Market Miner Pro 2026 — Initial Release (v1.0.0)

We are excited to launch the first official version of **Market Miner Pro 2026**! This application is designed to bridge the gap between complex financial data and actionable insights for retail investors.

---

### 💎 Key Features

* **Deep Market Data Mining**
  Seamlessly fetch comprehensive historical and real-time financial data via the **Yahoo Finance API**. Market Miner Pro doesn't just pull prices; it "mines" across multiple data points to give you a complete picture of a ticker's performance.

* **AI-Powered Trend Analysis (TensorFlow)**
  At the heart of Market Miner is a custom **TensorFlow** engine. TensorFlow is an industry-leading machine learning platform that allows the app to process vast amounts of historical data through a **Neural Network**.
  * **Predictive Modeling:** Utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers to identify complex temporal patterns in stock price movements.
  * **Data-Driven Insights:** Unlike simple moving averages, our AI looks for non-linear relationships in market volatility to help forecast potential trend shifts.

* **Ultra-Lightweight & Secure Installer**
  Experience a "zero-dependency" setup. The standalone Windows installer packages all necessary libraries into a single, optimized environment.

---

### ⚙️ Technical Stack
The application is built on **Python 3.12.9** for peak performance and modern syntax support. To ensure a professional-grade experience, we utilize a robust stack of industry-standard libraries:

* **TensorFlow:** Powers the deep learning and neural network logic.
* **yfinance:** Handles the secure extraction of market data from Yahoo Finance.
* **Pandas & NumPy:** For high-performance data manipulation and numerical computation.
* **Matplotlib:** Generates high-fidelity visual charts and trend graphs.
* **PySide6 / PyQt6:** Provides the sleek, modern Graphical User Interface (GUI).
